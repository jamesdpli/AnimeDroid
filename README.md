What each branch demonstartes:

Braches:

baseRecyclerViewExample -> Shows the Anime list with the stock RecyclerView implementation, later in commit "Refacor RecyclerView into ListAdapter" this is changed to ListAdapter.

passingDataWithBundle -> Shows passing data between two screens with the android os bundle rather than using safeArgs.

This is a work in progress
