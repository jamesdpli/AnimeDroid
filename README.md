What each branch demonstartes:

Braches:

baseRecyclerViewEample -> Shows the Anime list with the stock RecyclerView implementation, laterin commit "Refacor RecyclerView into ListAdapter) this is changed to ListAdapter as previously I was using notifyDataSetChanged() which is bad practice.

passingDataWithBundle -> Shows passing data between two screens with the android os bundle rather than using safeArgs.
